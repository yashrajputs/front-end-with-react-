Here are the answers:

Question 1: b) using <link> tag

To integrate a CSS file into an HTML file, you use the
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

Question 2: b) using <p> tag

To make a new paragraph in HTML, you use the
<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>

Question 3: b) false

The <div> tag is a block-level element, not an inline-block element. It takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.

Question 4: a) true

The <span> tag is an inline element, not a block-level element. It does not start on a new line and takes up only the space needed for its content.
Question 5: a) 100

The code calculates the value of y^y (10^10) and logs it to the console, then returns the result. So the output is 100.

Question 6:

A) To get the output array ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob'], you can use the map function:
people.map(person => person.name)

B) To get the output array with added "salary" property, you can use the map function:
people.map(person => ({...person, salary: 50000}))

C) To get the output array with only names and ages of people above 30 years old, you can use filter and map functions:
people.filter(person => person.age > 30).map(person => ({name: person.name, age: person.age}))

Q7:
function main(cb1, cb2, x, y) {
console.log(cb1(x, y)); // outputs: 15 (11 + 4)
console.log(cb2(x, y)); // outputs: 7 (11 - 4)
}

function cb1(x, y) {
return x + y;
}

function cb2(x, y) {
return x - y;
}

main(cb1, cb2, 11, 4);
Q8:
The correct answer is C) map function.

users.map(user => user.firstName + " " + user.lastName);

This will output: ["Susan Steward", "Daniel Longbottom", "Jacob Black"]

Q10:
The correct answer is C) [].

The filter function will return an empty array because the function "func" always returns false, which means no elements in the array pass the test.

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(func); // outputs: []
function func(v) {
return false;
}
Q11:
The correct answer is B) display: none removes the element from the DOM, while visibility: hidden just hides the element.

Display: none removes the element from the DOM, and the space it occupied is closed up, as if the element were never there. Visibility: hidden hides the element, but the space it occupied remains, and the element is still in the DOM.

Q12:
The correct answer is A) 4 10 18

Here's the breakdown:

1. a = 1, b = 0
2. First iteration: a = 2, b = 0 + (2 * 2) = 4 (logged to console)
3. Second iteration: a = 3, b = 4 + (3 * 2) = 10 (logged to console)
4. Third iteration: a = 4, b = 10 + (4 * 2) = 18 (logged to console)

The output will be: 4, 10, 18
The correct answer is C) [2,3,4,100].

Here's what happens:

1. arr.unshift(100) adds 100 to the beginning of the array, making arr = [100, 1, 2, 3, 4]
2. arr.shift() removes the first element (100) from the array, making arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
3. But, since shift() returns the removed element (100), the array is then reassigned to arr = [2, 3, 4, 100]

So, at the end of both operations, the value of arr is [2, 3, 4, 100].
